While several immune niche factors have been elucidated, the cues sustaining BRC function and topology across activation states remain unclear. Here, we employed single cell RNA-sequencing of human lymph node stromal cells and immune cells to analyse local BRC-immune cell interactions and compare them across SLOs and species from additional datasets. Shared BRC subsets were imprinted by tissue-specific gene signatures, but also expressed functionally convergent niche factors that directed regionalized leukocyte composition. Local BRC-immune cell interactions sustained BRC subset identity via immune cell-provided maturation factors. Bidirectional signalling programs were independent of activation state and mirrored across murine and human tissues. Collectively, our data reveal a conserved set of feedforward BRC-immune cell circuits that sustain topologically-organized, functional niches across inflammatory states, lymphoid organs and species.

Specialized immune-interacting fibroblasts, generally termed fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC), underpin distinct microenvironments within lymphoid organs to compartmentalize and direct the efficient interaction and activation of immune cells. As a particular anatomical property, palatine tonsils harbor a reticular-shaped lymphoepithelium that generates an antigen sampling zone in the crypts. While the histological ultrastructure and the immune cell composition of human palatine tonsils has been elaborated in detail, the molecular identity of the diverse stromal cell compartments including FRC and the specialized lymphoepithelium remains largely unknown. Here, we have employed single cell transcriptomics and extensive flow cytometric analyses to unveil the molecular identity of tonsillar cells and to disentangle the heterogeneity of fibroblast and epithelial cell subsets in palatine tonsils. Our results reveal a remarkable conservation of stromal cell organization and molecularly-defined subsets in infant and adult human palatine tonsils.

To elaborate the subset composition and topological organization of PP FRCs, we employed well-characterized Ccl19-Cre and Col6a1-Cre mouse models that permit FRC targeting in secondary lymphoid organs. To define PP FRC subsets and their relation to the observed FRC lineages, we isolated fibroblasts from Col6a1Eyfp and Ccl19Eyfp PPs and performed droplet-based single cell transcriptomics analysis. Taken together, the molecular definition of the PP FRC landscape reveals two FRC lineages furnishing distinct microenvironmental niches.

Here, definition of the embryonic origin and tracing of the differentiation trajectories of specialized white pulp fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) was enabled by the establishment of FRC-specific fate-mapping in mice. We found that all reticular cell subsets descend from pluripotent progenitors that emerge at embryonic day 19.5 from Sca-1+ periarterial progenitors. Commitment of FRC progenitors was concluded during the first week of postnatal life through occupation of niches along developing central arterioles. Single cell transcriptomic analysis facilitated deconvolution of FRC differentiation trajectories and suggested that perivascular reticular cells function both as adult lymphoid organizer cells and mural cell progenitors. Finally, the lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor-independent sustenance of postnatal progenitor stemness unveiled that systemic immune surveillance in the splenic white pulp is governed through subset specification of reticular cells from a pluripotent periarterial progenitor cell.
