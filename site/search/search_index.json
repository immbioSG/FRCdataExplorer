Despite their important role in steering innate and adaptive immunity, the age- and inflammation-associated changes in the molecular identity and functional properties of human FRCs have remained largely unknown. Here, we show that human tonsillar FRCs undergo dynamic reprogramming during life and respond vigorously to inflammatory perturbation in comparison to other stromal cell types. The PI16-expressing reticular cell (PI16+ RC) subset of adult tonsils exhibited the strongest inflammation-associated structural remodeling. Interactome analysis combined with ex vivo and in vitro validation revealed that T cell activity within subepithelial niches is controlled by distinct molecular pathways during PI16+ RC-lymphocyte interaction. Taken together, the topological and molecular definition of the human tonsillar stromal cell landscape reveals PI16+ RCs as specialized FRC niche at the core of mucosal immune responses in the oropharynx.

How BRCs are reprogrammed to cater to the developing GC remains unclear, and studying this process is largely hindered by incomplete resolution of the cellular composition of the B cell follicle. Here we used genetic targeting of Cxcl13-expressing cells to define the molecular identity of the BRC landscape. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that BRC subset specification was predetermined in the primary B cell follicle. Further topological remodeling of light and dark zone follicular dendritic cells required CXCL12-dependent crosstalk with B cells and dictated GC output by retaining B cells in the follicle and steering their interaction with follicular helper T cells. Together, our results reveal that poised BRC-defined microenvironments establish a feed-forward system that determines the efficacy of the GC reaction.

However, whether and to which extent immune cell activation is determined by lymph node FRC reprogramming during acute viral infection has remained unexplored. Here, we genetically ablated expression of the type I interferon-\u03b1 receptor (Ifnar) in Ccl19-Cre+ cells and found that sensing of type I interferon imprints an antiviral state in FRCs and thereby preserves myeloid cell composition in lymph nodes of naive mice. During localized lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection, IFNAR signaling precipitated profound phenotypic adaptation of all FRC subsets enhancing antigen presentation, chemokine-driven immune cell recruitment, and immune regulation. The IFNAR-dependent shift of all FRC subsets toward an immunostimulatory state reduced exhaustive CD8+ T cell activation. In sum, these results unveil intricate circuits underlying type I IFN sensing in lymph node FRCs that enable protective antiviral immunity.

Various cell-intrinsic pathways have been identified that determine ILC development and differentiation. However, the cellular components that regulate ILC sustenance and function in the intestinal lamina propria are less known. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lamina propria fibroblasts, we identify fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) that underpin cryptopatches (CPs) and isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs). Genetic ablation of lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor expression in Ccl19-expressing FRCs blocks the maturation of CPs into mature ILFs. Interactome analysis shows the major niche factors and processes underlying FRC-ILC crosstalk. In vivo validation confirms that a sustained lymphotoxin-driven feedforward loop of FRC activation including IL-7 generation is critical for the maintenance of functional ILC populations. In sum, our study indicates critical fibroblastic niches within the intestinal lamina propria that control ILC homeostasis and functionality and thereby secure protective gut immunity.

While the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying FRC differentiation in lymph nodes and the splenic white pulp have been elaborated to some extent, in Peyer\u2019s patches (PPs) they remain elusive. Using a combination of single-cell transcriptomics and cell fate mapping in advanced mouse models, we found that PP formation in the mouse embryo is initiated by an expansion of perivascular FRC precursors, followed by FRC differentiation from subepithelial progenitors. Single-cell transcriptomics and cell fate mapping confirmed the convergence of perivascular and subepithelial FRC lineages. Furthermore, lineage-specific loss- and gain-of-function approaches revealed that the two FRC lineages synergistically direct PP organization, maintain intestinal microbiome homeostasis and control anticoronavirus immune responses in the gut. Collectively, this study reveals a distinct mosaic patterning program that generates key stromal cell infrastructures for the control of intestinal immunity.

Here we establish fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-specific fate-mapping in mice to define their embryonic origin and differentiation trajectories. Our data show that all reticular cell subsets descend from multipotent progenitors emerging at embryonic day 19.5 from periarterial progenitors. Commitment of FRC progenitors is concluded during the first week of postnatal life through occupation of niches along developing central arterioles. Single cell transcriptomic analysis facilitated deconvolution of FRC differentiation trajectories and indicated that perivascular reticular cells function both as adult lymphoid organizer cells and mural cell progenitors. The lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor-independent sustenance of postnatal progenitor stemness unveils that systemic immune surveillance in the splenic white pulp is governed through subset specification of reticular cells from a multipotent periarterial progenitor cell. In sum, the finding that discrete signaling events in perivascular niches determine the differentiation trajectories of reticular cell networks explains the development of distinct microenvironmental niches in secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues that are crucial for the induction and regulation of innate and adaptive immune processes.

While properties of inflating memory CD8+ T cells have been characterized, the specific cell types and tissue factors responsible for their maintenance remain elusive. Here, we show that clinically applied adenovirus vectors preferentially target fibroblastic stromal cells in cultured human tissues. Moreover, we used cell-type-specific antigen targeting to define critical cells and molecules that sustain long-term antigen presentation and T cell activity after adenovirus vector immunization in mice. While antigen targeting to myeloid cells was insufficient to activate antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, genetic activation of antigen expression in Ccl19-cre-expressing fibroblastic stromal cells induced inflating CD8+ T cells. Local ablation of vector-targeted cells revealed that lung fibroblasts support the protective function and metabolic fitness of inflating memory CD8+ T cells in an interleukin (IL)-33-dependent manner.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts are generally seen as tumor-promoting entity. However, it is conceivable that particular FSC populations within the TME contribute to immune-mediated tumor control. Here, we show that intratumoral treatment of mice with a recombinant lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-based vaccine vector expressing a melanocyte differentiation antigen resulted in T cell-dependent long-term control of melanomas. Using single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we demonstrate that viral vector-mediated transduction reprogrammed and activated a Cxcl13-expressing FSC subset that show a pronounced immunostimulatory signature and increased expression of the inflammatory cytokine IL-33. Ablation of Il33 gene expression in Cxcl13-Cre-positive FSCs reduces the functionality of intratumoral T cells and unleashes tumor growth. Thus, reprogramming of FSCs by a self-antigen-expressing viral vector in the TME is critical for curative melanoma treatment by locally sustaining the activity of tumor-specific T cells.
